# PETSc wrappers

List of of the Julia wrappers for the C functions and objects of the PETSc library. This is an incomplete list, based on what has been used in the past. If you are missing a wrapper for a specific function, it can be easily added using the [`GridapPETSc.PETSC.@wrapper`](@ref) macro.

```@index
Modules = [GridapPETSc.PETSC]

```@autodocs
Modules = [GridapPETSc.PETSC]
